1. about non-analyzed

To prevent this from happening, we need to tell Elasticsearch that this field contains
an exact value by setting it to be not_analyzed. We saw this originally in “Customizing
Field Mappings” on page 89. To do this, we need to first delete our old index
(because it has the incorrect mapping) and create a new one with the correct mappings:
DELETE /my_store
PUT /my_store
{
"mappings" : {
"products" : {
"properties" : {
"productID" : {
"type" : "string",
"index" : "not_analyzed"
}
}
}
}
}
